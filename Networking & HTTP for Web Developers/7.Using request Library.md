# Using request Library

## Overview

This assignment introduces the `request` library in Node.js as a simpler alternative to the `net` and built-in `http` libraries for making HTTP requests.

## Introducing the `request` Module

### Simplifying HTTP Requests
- **Library Purpose**: The `request` module simplifies the process of making HTTP requests in Node.js.
- **How It Works**: Internally, `request` uses the `http` module, which in turn relies on `net`, similar to our previous exercises.

### Basic Usage
- **Example Code**:
  ```javascript
  const request = require('request');
  request('http://www.google.com', (error, response, body) => {
    console.log('error:', error);
    console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode);
    console.log('body:', body);
  });
  ```
- **Functionality**: Makes an asynchronous request to a server and retrieves the response.

## Experimenting with `request`

### Setting Up
- **Create Directory**: Make a new directory called `requestExample`.
- **Initialize and Install**: Run `npm init` and `npm install request` to set up the library.

### Testing Different Scenarios
- **Experimenting with Domains**:
  - Test with a simple website like `example.edu` instead of `google.com`.
  - Observe behavior when accessing a non-existent domain.
  - Check the response when requesting a valid domain but a missing page (e.g., `https://www.google.com/fdsafsafsa.html`).

### Hypotheses and Observations
- **Formulate Predictions**: Before running each test, hypothesize about the expected outcome.
- **Analyze Results**: Understand the results in terms of error messages, status codes, and response bodies.

## Conclusion

- **Ease of Use**: The `request` library offers a straightforward and powerful way to make various types of HTTP requests in Node.js, including GET and POST.
- **Professional Approach**: Using libraries like `request` is a more realistic and professional method for handling HTTP requests in real-world applications.
