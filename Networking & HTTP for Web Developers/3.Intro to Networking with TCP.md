# Intro to Networking with TCP 

## Overview

This activity focuses on creating a basic client-server interaction using TCP in Node.js, providing a practical introduction to networking concepts.

## Setting Up for TCP Networking

### Creating Directories and Files
- **Directories**: Set up a `networking` folder, and within that, a `net_example` subdirectory.
- **Files**: Create `server.js` and `client.js` within the `net_example` directory.

### Running Server and Client
- **Server**: Run `server.js` in one terminal to start the server.
- **Client**: Run `client.js` in another terminal to start the client.

## Creating a TCP Server

### Basic Server Setup
- **Code Sample**:
  ```javascript
  const net = require("net");
  const server = net.createServer();
  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server listening on port 3000!");
  });
  ```
- **Behavior**: Server listens on port 3000 and remains open for connections.

### Handling Client Connections
- **Server Code Enhancement**:
  ```javascript
  server.on("connection", (client) => {
    console.log("New client connected!");
    client.write("Hello there!");
  });
  ```
- **Effect**: Server detects new client connections and sends a greeting.

## Creating a TCP Client

### Basic Client Connection
- **Code Sample**:
  ```javascript
  const net = require("net");
  const conn = net.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3000,
  });
  conn.setEncoding("utf8");
  ```
- **Behavior**: Client attempts to connect to the server on `localhost` at port `3000`.

### Handling Server Data
- **Client Code Enhancement**:
  ```javascript
  conn.on("data", (data) => {
    console.log("Server says: ", data);
  });
  ```
- **Effect**: Client receives and prints the data sent by the server.

## Two-way Communication

### Client Sending Data to Server
- **Client Code**:
  ```javascript
  conn.on("connect", () => {
    conn.write("Hello from client!");
  });
  ```

### Server Receiving Data from Client
- **Server Code Enhancement**:
  ```javascript
  client.setEncoding("utf8");
  client.on("data", (data) => {
    console.log("Message from client: ", data);
  });
  ```

## Key Takeaways

- **TCP Basics**: TCP enables reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.
- **Client-Server Model**: The client initiates the connection; the server listens and responds.
- **Language Agnostic**: TCP-based communication is not restricted to Node.js and can be implemented in various programming languages.
- **Real-world Analogy**: Similar to a phone call where one party calls (client) and the other answers (server), with both able to communicate.

## Conclusion

- **Foundation**: This exercise lays the groundwork for understanding client-server networking.
- **Next Steps**: The upcoming activities will expand on these concepts, including connecting over the internet and further exploring TCP's capabilities.
