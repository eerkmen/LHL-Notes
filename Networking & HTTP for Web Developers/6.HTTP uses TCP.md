# HTTP uses TCP

## Overview

This assignment explores how HTTP operates over a TCP connection, exemplified through creating a simple HTTP request using Node's `net` module.

## HTTP and TCP Connection

### Understanding the Relationship
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: A text-based protocol used for communication over a TCP connection.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Underlying protocol that facilitates the connection and data transfer between client and server.

## Creating an HTTP Request with TCP

### Setting Up the Environment
- **File Creation**: Create `httpExample.js` in the `net` folder.
- **Target**: Make an HTTP GET request to `example.edu`.

### Basic TCP Connection
- **Code Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  const net = require('net');
  const conn = net.createConnection({ 
    host: 'example.edu',
    port: 80
  });
  conn.setEncoding('UTF8');
  ```
- **Expected Behavior**: Initially, the connection appears to hang, as the server awaits a request from the client.

### Making an HTTP Request
- **Request Setup**: Upon connection, send a simple HTTP 1.1 request.
  ```javascript
  conn.on('connect', () => {
    conn.write(`GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n`);
    conn.write(`Host: example.edu\r\n`);
    conn.write(`\r\n`);
  });
  ```
- **Action**: Requests the homepage (`/`) from the server.

### Receiving the HTTP Response
- **Response Handling**:
  ```javascript
  conn.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
    conn.end();
  });
  ```
- **Outcome**: Server returns the HTML source code for the requested page and response details.

## Key Concepts

### HTTP Over TCP
- **Operation**: HTTP uses TCP to establish connections and facilitate communication.
- **Process**: 
  - Browser opens a TCP connection (usually on port 80 or 443 for HTTPS).
  - Sends text-based HTTP commands like `GET /path-to-page HTTP/1.1\r\n`.
  - Waits for the server's response, which could be HTML, CSS, JS, or other document types.

## Conclusion

- **Insight**: This exercise demonstrates the foundational understanding of how HTTP and TCP work together, enabling web browsers and servers to communicate effectively.
- **Next Steps**: While direct HTTP requests via TCP are possible, Node offers more purpose-built libraries for simpler implementation.
- **Realization**: Every web page access involves an HTTP request over a TCP connection, highlighting the importance of understanding these protocols for web development.
