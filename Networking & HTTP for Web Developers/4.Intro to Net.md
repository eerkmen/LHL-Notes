# Intro to Net

## Overview

This stretch activity extends the Intro to Net assignment, focusing on setting up a basic TCP server and client to communicate over the internet. It provides a hands-on experience in networking and is recommended as a follow-up to the core exercises.

## Enabling Remote Access: TCP Tunneling

### Setting Up ngrok
- **Purpose**: ngrok allows you to create a public address for your server, enabling access from outside your local network.
- **Installation**: Install ngrok globally using npm in Vagrant.
  ```bash
  npm install ngrok -g
  ```
- **Account Setup**: Sign up for an ngrok account and authenticate in Vagrant using your authtoken.
  ```bash
  ngrok authtoken <your token here>
  ```
- **Starting the Tunnel**: Use ngrok to tunnel TCP data to your server on port 3000.
  ```bash
  ngrok tcp 3000
  ```
- **Result**: ngrok provides a public address and port, forwarding data to your local server.

## Pairing Exercise

### Role Distribution
- **Approach**: Pair up with someone in your cohort. One person acts as the server, the other as the client.
- **Collaboration**: Work together on each part, observing and assisting each other.

### Connecting Server and Client
- **Server**: Run the `server.js` script, making sure it's accessible via ngrok.
- **Client**: Enter the ngrok host and port information into `client.js` and run the script.
- **Outcome**: If successful, connection messages from the previous activity should appear.

### Role Reversal
- **Recommendation**: If time allows, switch roles to gain experience on both sides of the TCP connection.

## Troubleshooting
- **Issues**: Connection problems can arise; refer to troubleshooting steps from the previous activity or seek mentor assistance.
- **Termination**: Remember to terminate the `server.js` script with `ctrl + c` after completion.

## Conclusion

- **Reflection**: This activity demonstrates the ease of setting up a server that can be accessed over the internet.
- **Next Steps**: Upcoming lessons will build upon these networking fundamentals, including applications like online games.
- **Importance**: Understanding these initial steps is crucial for further exploration in server development and internet-based applications.
