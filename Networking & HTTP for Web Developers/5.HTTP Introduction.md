# HTTP Introduction

## Overview

This reading provides an introduction to the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol, covering its basic components like URL structure, request headers, response codes, and other key aspects.

## Understanding HyperText
- **HyperText**: Text containing links to other texts.
- **Significance**: The basis of HTTP and HTML, originating from the 1960s.

## HTTP Protocol
- **Function**: A protocol for reading and writing resources (data) in a text-based manner.
- **Usage**: Initially for HTML documents, now expanded to various types of web resources.

## HTTP Flow
- **Nature**: Request-response based protocol.
- **Process**: The client sends a request to the server, which responds with the requested resource.
- **Reference**: MDN's [HTTP Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) document.

## HTTP Requests
- **Components**: Consist of a PATH and a METHOD.
- **PATH**: Specifies the resource the client wants to act on.
- **METHOD**: Indicates the action the client wants to perform.

## HTTP Methods (Verbs)
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Create new data.
- **PUT**: Edit existing data on the server.
- **DELETE**: Remove existing data.

## Paths and URL Structures
- **Components of a URL**:
  - Protocol
  - Domain (or Host)
  - Port
  - Resource Path
  - Query Parameters
  - Anchor
- **Reference**: MDN's [Understanding URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL) article.

## HTTP Responses
- **Response Content**:
  - **Status Code**: Indicates whether the operation was successful.
  - **Body**: Contains the data requested by the client.
- **Common Status Codes**:
  - 200: Successful operation.
  - 201: Resource created successfully.
  - 404: Resource not found.
  - 500: Server error.

## Response Body
- **Formats**: Can store data in various formats like text or images.
- **Common Formats**: HTML pages or JSON data.

## Headers
- **Purpose**: To inject additional information into requests and responses.
- **Format**: Key-value pairs.
- **Usage**: Various, explored in more depth in future projects.

## Conclusion
- **HTTP Essentials**:
  - Text-based protocol for client-server communication.
  - Requests contain methods and paths.
  - Responses include status codes and body content.
  - Both requests and responses can have headers.
- **Context**: Understanding HTTP is critical for web development, forming the foundation for how browsers and servers communicate.
