# Intro to Networking and TCP

## Overview

This reading provides an introduction to the concepts of networking and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), essential for understanding how computers communicate in a networked environment.

## Introduction to Networking

### Definition of a Network
- **Computer Network**: Connection between two or more computers enabling communication.
- **Examples**:
  - Direct connection like phone to laptop via USB or Bluetooth.
  - Indirect connection via a common WiFi router.

### The Internet vs. Networking
- **Clarification**: The internet is a network, but not all networks are the internet. Networking is broader and includes any interconnected devices.
- **Internet**: The world's largest and most well-known network.

### Scope of Networking Knowledge
- **TMI Alert**: While detailed knowledge of local networks and internet structure is interesting, it's not immediately necessary for building networked applications.

## Introduction to TCP

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Function**: Provides a standardized way for machines to communicate.
- **Analogous to Phone Calls**: Establishes a two-way communication channel, where data can be sent and received until one party terminates the connection.

### Establishing a TCP Connection
- **IP Address**: Analogous to a phone number used to dial and establish a connection.
- **Ports**: Similar to phone extensions in a company, allowing for specific network applications to communicate.
- **Process**: One side initiates the connection using the IP address and port of the destination.

### Illustration of TCP Connection
- **Example**: Calling a company, where you dial a number and choose an extension to connect to a specific department.
- **In Networking**: The IP address is the main number, and the port is the extension.

## Conclusion

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Networks enable communication between computers/devices.
  - Networking operations are generally slower than local operations like writing to disk.
  - TCP is a crucial protocol for structuring data flow over a network, commonly used in various applications.
