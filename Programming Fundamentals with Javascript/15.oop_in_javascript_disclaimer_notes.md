# OOP in JavaScript: A Disclaimer

## Overview

This note addresses the nuances of teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using JavaScript, acknowledging JavaScript's unique approach to OOP.


## Key Points


### JavaScript and OOP

- JavaScript isn't fully object-oriented but is used to teach OOP due to familiarity.

- Originally, JavaScript’s object system was based on prototypes, not classes.



### Classes in JavaScript

- Classes, prevalent in many OO languages, were introduced in JavaScript with ES6.

- They offer a simplified approach to OOP and ease the transition to other OO languages.

- Classes in JavaScript are syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based system.



### The Shift in JavaScript OOP

- Post-ES6, using classes has become the preferred OOP method in JavaScript.

- However, understanding prototypes remains important for experienced JavaScript developers.

- For beginners, it's essential to recognize the existence of prototypes and their role in JavaScript's history.



## Conclusion

While JavaScript’s approach to OOP differs from classical OO languages, learning OOP through JavaScript's classes provides a foundational understanding applicable across various programming languages.
