# JavaScript Functions as Objects and First-Class Citizens

## Overview
JavaScript treats functions as first-class objects, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and have properties assigned to them.

## Functions as First-Class Citizens
- **Definition**: In programming, a first-class citizen can be passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable.
- **History**: The concept was introduced by Christopher Strachey in the 1960s, initially contrasting real numbers and procedures in ALGOL.
- **Rights of First-Class Citizens**: According to Robin Popplestone, items that are first-class citizens have fundamental rights, including being actual parameters of functions, being returned as results, being the subject of assignment statements, and being tested for equality.

## JavaScript Specifics
- **Functions Storage and Properties**: Functions can be stored in variables, and properties can be added to them, just like any other object.
  
  ```javascript
  const myFn = function() {
    console.log("I am function.");
  }
  
  myFn.someAttribute = 42;
  console.log(myFn.someAttribute);
  
  function runner(f) {
    f();
  }
  
  runner(myFn);
  ```

- **Callback Functions**: Functions are often used as callbacks, where they are passed to other functions to be called back at a later time.

  ```javascript
  const findWaldo = function(names, found) {
    for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
      let name = names[i];
      if (name === "Waldo") {
        found();   // execute callback
      }
    }
  }
  
  const actionWhenFound = function() {
    console.log("Found him!");
  }
  
  findWaldo(["Alice", "Bob", "Waldo", "Winston"], actionWhenFound);
  ```

## Additional Information
- **Data Types**: Scalar data types are almost always first-class in many languages. Arrays and strings may not be first-class in older languages【39†source】.
- **Continuations and GOTO-labels**: Few languages treat continuations and GOTO-labels as first-class objects.
- **Languages Supporting First-Class Functions**: Many modern languages, including JavaScript, support first-class functions, closures, and anonymous functions.

Remember, understanding and utilizing the concept of functions as first-class citizens allows for more flexible and powerful programming patterns in JavaScript.
