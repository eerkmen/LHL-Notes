# Rubber Duck Debugging

Software developers have a novel tactic for debugging code known as *Rubber Duck Debugging*. The concept involves explaining your code line-by-line to a rubber duck, as if it were sentient. This act of explaining can often help you identify and fix issues in the code.

The efficacy of this technique is surprising. Wikipedia explains that many programmers find solutions to their problems in the process of explaining them to someone else, even if that someone knows nothing about programming. The discrepancy between what the code is supposed to do and what it actually does becomes apparent when one teaches or explains the subject, leading to a deeper understanding. By using an inanimate object like a rubber duck, a programmer can achieve this without interrupting anyone else.

At Lighthouse Labs, you might see a poster of Larry The Rubber Duck that encourages this debugging method. The steps are simple:

1. Obtain a rubber duck by any means necessary.
2. Place it on your desk and tell it you're going to review some code together.
3. Go through your code in detail, line by line.
4. Eventually, you'll explain what you're going to do next and realize that's not what the code is doing. At that moment, the rubber duck, in its serenity, has aided you on your way.
