# Introduction to Unit Testing

## Overview
This reading focuses on automated unit testing, explaining its usefulness in improving code reliability and reducing debugging time.

## Key Concepts

### The Power of Automated Testing
- Automates the repetitive process of manual testing.
- Enhances code reliability and reduces debugging time.

### The Concept of Unit Testing
- Unit testing is writing code to test other pieces of code.
- It serves as a 'magic button' to quickly check if code changes work as expected.
- Helps in maintaining and adding new features efficiently.

### Unit Testing in Practice
- Involves writing simple code that tests functions.
- Example: Testing a `largestNumber` function with an assertion to check if it returns the correct result.

### The Way Forward
- Moving from custom assertion functions to more structured and advanced testing using libraries and tools.
- Emphasizing on the importance of formalizing the process and structure of writing test code.

## Conclusion
Unit testing is an essential practice in software development, offering a systematic and automated approach to verify code functionality and robustness.
