# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

## Overview
This reading introduces Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in the context of software development, particularly in relation to JavaScript.

## Key Concepts

### What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- A programming paradigm that focuses on using objects to achieve modularity and reduce code duplication.
- Became popular with languages like Ruby, Java, C#, and later, JavaScript.

### Brief History of OOP
- Originated in the 1960s, gaining popularity in the 1990s with languages like C++.
- Encourages writing code that is modular, reducing duplication through objects.

### OOP Languages
- Examples include C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Swift, and Objective-C.
- These languages are predominantly OO and form the basis of modern software development.

### JavaScript and OOP
- JavaScript supports multiple paradigms, including Functional Programming and OOP.
- With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript enhanced its OOP capabilities.
- Learning OOP in JavaScript provides a unique opportunity to understand OO evolutionarily.

## Conclusion
- OOP is vital in modern software development for code organization and reusability.
- JavaScript's flexibility in supporting both OOP and Functional Programming paradigms makes it a powerful language to learn these concepts.
