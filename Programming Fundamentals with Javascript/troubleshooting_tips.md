# Troubleshooting Tips

When you hit a snag in your coding journey, it's not always necessary to seek immediate help. Instead, try this troubleshooting guide first.

## The Troubleshooting Guide

Before declaring yourself stuck, go through this checklist:

- Have you pseudo-coded the solution?
- Have you googled the error message you're receiving?
- Have you actually read the error message carefully?
- Have you double-checked your syntax?
- Have you used a linter on your code?
- Have you tried pair programming or asked a peer to review your code?
- Have you explained the problem to a rubber duck (or equivalent)?

If you've answered 'yes' to all these questions and still find yourself at an impasse, then it's time to ask for a mentor's assistance. You've done your due diligence.

Remember, the process of elimination through these steps can often lead you to the solution independently.
