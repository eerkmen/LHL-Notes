# Objects in JavaScript - Basic Concepts

## Overview

Understanding objects is fundamental in JavaScript as they allow you to store key-value pairs, with unique keys that map to values which can be of any type.

## Object Literals

- Objects are denoted by curly braces `{}`.
- An empty object is defined as `const emptyObject = {};`.
- Object keys are strings and can be written without quotes if they are valid identifiers.

## Objects as Tables

Think of objects as a two-column table with keys as the first column and values as the second.

## Object Values

Values in an object can be of any type, including other objects or arrays.

```javascript
const myObject = {
  a: 6,    // Number
  b: "abc" // String
  // ... other key-value pairs
};
```

## Accessing Object Values

- Use square-bracket notation to access values: `object["key"]`.
- If a key does not exist, accessing it returns `undefined`.

## Assigning Values to Keys

- New values can be assigned to keys using square brackets: `object["key"] = value;`.

## Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects as values.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Paul",
  address: {
    street: "310 W 95th",
    city: "New York",
    // ... more nested object key-value pairs
  }
};
```

## Arrays as Values

Arrays can also be assigned as values to object keys.

```javascript
person["phoneNumbers"] = ["123-4567", "234-5678"];
```

## Object Keys

- Keys are unique strings within an object.
- If the key is a valid identifier, quotes are optional.

## Using `Object.keys`

- `Object.keys(object)` returns an array of the object's keys.

This note summarized the creation, manipulation, and access of objects in JavaScript, highlighting their flexibility and foundational role in the language.
