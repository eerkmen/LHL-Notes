# OOP Part 3: Super - Study Notes

## Overview

This reading focuses on using the `super` keyword in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to enhance code sharing between classes through inheritance. It addresses method overriding and the effective use of `super`.

## Method Overriding and Super
- **Problem**: Subclasses sometimes need similar but slightly different behavior compared to their superclass.
- **Context**: Modifying the behavior of the `bio` method in a subclass (e.g., `Mentor`) of the `Person` class.

### Solution Part 1: Method Override
- **Method Overriding**: Implementing a method in the subclass that exists in the superclass.
- **Example**:
    ```javascript
    class Person {
      // ... constructor and bio method
    }

    class Mentor extends Person {
      bio() {
        return `I'm a mentor at Lighthouse Labs. My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
      }
    }
    ```
- **Implication**: The subclass's version of the method (`bio`) is executed instead of the superclass's version.

### Solution Part 2: Use `super`
- **`super` Keyword**: Allows a subclass to call methods of its superclass, reducing code repetition.
- **Example**:
    ```javascript
    class Mentor extends Person {
      bio() {
        return `I'm a mentor at Lighthouse Labs. ${super.bio()}`;
      }
    }
    ```
- **Usage**: `super.bio()` calls the `bio` method from `Person` class.

## Exercise
- **Task**: Modify the `Student` class so that its `bio` method starts with a specific introduction before continuing with the rest of the bio sentence.

## Conclusion
- **Key Learnings**:
  1. **Method Overriding**: Useful for changing behavior in subclasses.
  2. **Using `super`**: Prevents repetition of code present in the superclass and maintains DRY principles.
