# Automated Testing

## Overview
This module covers the concept of automated testing in software development, highlighting its importance and different types.

## Key Concepts

### What is Automated Testing?
- Automated testing involves writing code to test other code programmatically.
- It replaces manual testing, saving time and improving code quality.

### Benefits of Automated Testing
- Saves time by reducing repetitive manual tests.
- Catches bugs earlier in the development process.
- Simplifies programming by focusing only on the part being worked on.
- Acts as a form of documentation.
- Enhances code quality.

### Types of Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions or components in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing how different parts of the application work together.
- **Functional Testing**: Also known as E2E or browser testing, it tests the complete functionality of an application.

### The Concept of Happy Path Testing
- Testing the ideal scenarios where everything works as expected.
- Important to test but insufficient alone for reliable applications.

## Conclusion
Automated testing is essential in modern software development, offering a range of benefits from time-saving to improved code quality. It encompasses different types, each serving a specific purpose in the development lifecycle.
