# Plagiarism and Collaborative Work in Coding

## Plagiarism Policy

Lighthouse Labs emphasizes the importance of academic honesty. Plagiarism, which is passing someone else's code off as your own, will lead to dismissal from the program.

## Using External Resources

- Use outside sources responsibly.
- Ensure all submitted work is your own.
- Understand and be able to explain every piece of your code.
- Thoroughly comment your code to explain what it does and cite any outside sources.
- Make frequent and descriptive commits to your git repository to show progression.

## Collaborative Work

- Code from paired programming sessions can be considered your own if you were actively involved in its creation.
- Clearly indicate which portions of your project were done through pair programming and acknowledge the peers involved.
- Use GitHub @mentions in your commit messages to credit peers, e.g., `Pairing with @githubusername`.

## Example Commit Message
