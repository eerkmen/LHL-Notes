# Higher-Order Functions and Map in JavaScript

## Higher-Order Functions
- **Definition**: Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are known as Higher-Order Functions.
- **Role in Functional Programming**: These are a key concept in Functional Programming, allowing for functions to be treated as values and passed around.
- **Built-in Examples**: JavaScript's `forEach`, `filter`, `map`, etc.

## Array.prototype.map
- **Purpose**: Transforms an array by applying a function to each element and returns a new array.
- **Usage**:
  ```javascript
  const lighthouses = ["Gibraltar Point", "Peggy's Point", "Cove Island"];
  
  const lengths = lighthouses.map(lighthouse => lighthouse.length);
  // lengths is [15, 13, 11]
  ```
- **Syntax Variations**:
  - Arrow function: `x => x * 2`
  - Explicit return: `(x) => { return x * 2; }`
  - Traditional function: `function(x) { return x * 2; }`

### Exercise
Transform an array of lighthouse names into an array of their respective name lengths using `map`.

```javascript
const lighthouses = ["Gibraltar Point", "Peggy's Point", "Cove Island"];

// Using map to transform the array
const nameLengths = lighthouses.map(name => name.length);
console.log(nameLengths); // Expected output: [15, 13, 11]
```
