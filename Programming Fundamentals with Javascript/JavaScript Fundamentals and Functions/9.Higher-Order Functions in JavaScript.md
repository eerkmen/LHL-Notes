# Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

## Overview

Higher-order functions are a cornerstone of functional programming in JavaScript. They are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. This concept enables a powerful and expressive way of structuring code that is both concise and readable.

## Characteristics

- **Accept Callbacks**: They can take other functions as arguments.
- **Return Functions**: They may also return functions as results.
- **Built-in Examples**: JavaScript's `Array.prototype` methods like `forEach` and `filter` are built-in higher-order functions.

## Functional Programming

- **Concept**: Functional programming (FP) is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
- **Pure Functions**: FP emphasizes the use of pure functions and avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
- **Higher-Order Functions in FP**: Higher-order functions are integral to FP, facilitating the creation of abstractions and manipulating functions with ease.

## Practical Usage

In JavaScript, higher-order functions are used extensively for operations on collections, asynchronous operations, and in many patterns that require abstracting functionality, such as:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0); // [2, 4] using higher-order function `filter`
```

By understanding higher-order functions, developers can write more declarative code, which is easier to reason about and often more concise.
