# JavaScript Callbacks for Sorting

## `.sort()` Function in JavaScript
- JavaScript arrays have a `.sort()` method for sorting array items.
- By default, `.sort()` treats elements as strings, leading to lexicographical order, not numerical.
- This default behavior is acknowledged as a poor design choice but remains for backward compatibility.

## Numeric Sorting
To sort numerically:
```javascript
const array = [10, 2, 5, 1, 9];
array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

## Advanced Sorting with Custom Comparator
To sort by multiple criteria (e.g., name, then age):
```javascript
const students = [
  { id: 1, name: "bruce", age: 40 },
  // ... other students
];
students.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.name === b.name) {
    return b.age - a.age; // descending age
  }
  return a.name.localeCompare(b.name); // ascending name
});
```

## Key Points
- `.sort()` modifies the original array.
- For numbers, provide a comparator function to avoid lexicographical sorting.
- Custom comparators are essential for sorting based on multiple or complex criteria.
