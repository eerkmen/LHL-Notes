# Iterating Over Objects in JavaScript

## Introduction

This note explains how to iterate over the properties and values of JavaScript objects using `for...in` loops, as objects do not provide an iterable interface like arrays.

## Iterating Over Objects

To iterate over an object's properties, use the `for...in` loop. 

```javascript
for (var key in myObject) {
  // Access the value associated with the key
  console.log(key + ': ' + myObject[key]);
}
```

## Example

Given an object `planetMoons` with keys representing planets and values representing the number of moons:

```javascript
var planetMoons = {
  mercury: 0,
  venus: 0,
  earth: 1,
  mars: 2,
  // ... other planets
};
```

Iterate over it as follows:

```javascript
for (var planet in planetMoons) {
  var numberOfMoons = planetMoons[planet];
  console.log("Planet: " + planet + ", # of Moons: "+ numberOfMoons);
}
```

## Limitations and Cautions

The `for...in` loop will iterate over all enumerable properties, including inherited ones, so it's often necessary to check if the property is a direct property of the object:

```javascript
for (var planet in planetMoons) {
  if (planetMoons.hasOwnProperty(planet)) {
    console.log("Planet: " + planet + ", # of Moons: "+ planetMoons[planet]);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

While JavaScript objects are not inherently iterable, `for...in` loops provide a method to iterate over their keys and values. It is important to use `hasOwnProperty` to avoid unexpected results from inherited properties.
