# Closures in JavaScript

## Understanding Closures

- **Closures** are functions that retain access to the scope in which they were created, meaning they can access variables from their parent functions even after those parent functions have completed execution.
- This behavior is due to JavaScript's **lexical scoping** rules, where a child function has access to the scope of its parent function.

## Example of Closure

```javascript
const outer = function() {
  const x = 10;
  const inner = function() {
    console.log("The value of x is: " + x);
  }
  return inner;
};

const foo = outer();
foo(); // Outputs: The value of x is: 10
```

## Key Points

- The `inner` function is a closure that captures and retains the variable `x` from its containing function, `outer`, even after `outer` has finished execution.
- Closures are a fundamental and powerful feature in JavaScript, enabling private data and modular code.

## Immediately-invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

- An **IIFE** is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.
- It creates a closure, but the immediately-invoked aspect means it runs once and does not allow for multiple instances.

```javascript
const foo = (function() {
  const x = 10;
  return function() {
    console.log("Value of x is: " + x);
  };
})(); // IIFE

foo(); // Outputs: Value of x is: 10
```

- IIFEs are useful for creating private variables and initialization code that do not pollute the global namespace.

## Limitations of IIFEs

- You cannot directly create multiple instances of a closure with an IIFE because it executes immediately and just once by design.
- To create new instances, the function would need to be defined in a way that it can be invoked multiple times.

## Further Reading

- For a deeper dive into closures, consider reading the "Closure" section of *Eloquent JavaScript* or visiting the [MDN documentation on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).
