# Filtering Using Callbacks in JavaScript

## Overview
Callbacks in JavaScript can be used to filter an array. The `Array.prototype.filter` method iterates over an array and applies a callback function to each element. The callback returns `true` or `false` to include or exclude the element from the resulting array.

## Example
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18];
const evens = numbers.filter(function(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});
console.log("Subset of even numbers:", evens);
```

## Points to Note
- The anonymous callback function checks if a number is even.
- Functions passed to `filter` are often anonymous as they are used inline.
- `filter` does not modify the original array but returns a new one.

## Practice Challenge
Given an array of grades, write a script to filter out and print passing grades (70 or above).

## Tips
- Start with a named callback function, then refactor to an anonymous inline function.
- Convert the anonymous function into an arrow function for practice.
