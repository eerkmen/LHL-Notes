# Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

## Introduction

This lecture note covers the basic primitive data types in JavaScript. The focus will be on understanding the types of data you will encounter, without delving into the more complex quirks of JavaScript.

## Understanding Primitive Data Types

JavaScript has six primitive data types, which are the simplest forms of data:

- `undefined`
- `null`
- `boolean`
- `string`
- `number`
- `symbol` (Introduced in ES6, not a focus for beginners)

All values in JavaScript that are not objects are considered to be primitives.

## Distinction from Objects

In contrast to primitives, JavaScript treats the following as objects:

- Dates
- Arrays
- Functions (functions are a subcategory of objects)

Objects in JavaScript can have properties and represent more complex data structures.

## Conclusion

This note introduced the concept of primitive data types in JavaScript and how they are distinguished from objects. More complex data types, like arrays, dates, and key-value pairs, are formed using objects.
