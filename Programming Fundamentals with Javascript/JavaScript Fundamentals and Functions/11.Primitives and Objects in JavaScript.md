# Primitives and Objects in JavaScript

## Key Concepts

- **Primitive Values & Properties**: JavaScript primitive values (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) don't inherently have properties or methods.
  
- **Primitive Wrappers**: Despite the above, JavaScript allows access to methods like `"hello".toUpperCase()` due to wrappers that temporarily convert primitives to objects.

- **Object Constructors**: Each primitive has a corresponding object constructor (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`).

## Examples

```javascript
const someString = "Lighthouse Labs";
console.log(someString.toUpperCase()); // 'LIGHTHOUSE LABS'
```

- **Type Coercion**: JavaScript coerces primitives to their object counterparts when using methods.

```javascript
'1' == 1; // true due to type coercion
'1' === 1; // false because they're different types
```

- **Comparison of Primitives & Object Wrappers**:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
const objGreeting = new String("Hello, world!");
greeting == objGreeting; // true, type coercion compares their primitive values
greeting === objGreeting; // false, one is a primitive and the other is an object
```

## Conclusion

- JavaScript's type coercion allows primitives to act like objects when necessary, which is a unique aspect of the language's design and offers flexibility in coding.
