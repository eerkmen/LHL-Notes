# Intro to Async Control Flow 

## Overview

This reading provides an introduction to asynchronous control flow in JavaScript, particularly in the context of Node.js.

## Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

### Definition
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Executing tasks separately from the main program thread and notifying the program upon completion.
- **Contrast with Synchronous Programming**: In synchronous programming, the main thread waits for a task to complete before continuing, leading to potential idle time.

### Real-world Analogy
- **Party Preparation Scenario**: You (main program thread) assign a task (asynchronous function) to a friend (another thread). While your friend is completing the task, you continue with other preparations.
- **Key Point**: Asynchronous programming allows the main thread to continue executing other tasks without waiting for the completion of a separate task.

### Asynchronous Callbacks
- **Callback Functions**: JavaScript uses callback functions to handle time-consuming tasks like I/O operations.
- **Example**: Writing to a file using `fs.writeFile` in Node.js.
  ```javascript
  const fs = require("fs");

  console.log('BEFORE writeFile call');

  fs.writeFile("./test_async.txt", "h3ll0 file!\n", (error) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log("Failed to write to file");
      return;
    }
    console.log("Successfully wrote to file");
  });

  console.log('AFTER writeFile call');
  ```
- **Observation**: The `console.log` statements execute in an order that might not be intuitive at first, demonstrating asynchronous execution.

### Understanding Output
- **Question**: What order do the `console.log` statements execute?
- **Answer**: The logs before and after the `writeFile` call will execute first, followed by the callback's log statement, illustrating asynchronous behavior.

## Conclusion
- **Asynchronous Control Flow**: A common and crucial aspect of software development in Node and JavaScript.
- **Callbacks**: A standard technique for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
