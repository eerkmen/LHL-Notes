# Function Best Practices - Introduction

## Key Points
- Functions encapsulate code, avoid repetition, and improve readability.
- They can have quirks that are challenging for new JavaScript developers.

## Growing Functions
- Functions often arise from the need to avoid repeating code or when a new functionality is needed.
- Good function names are crucial for clarity.
- Example provided: A `printFarmInventory` function to output zero-padded numbers of animals.
- Refactoring is key when function grows to handle new cases, like adding pigs to the farm inventory.

## Functions & Side Effects
- Functions should either perform an action (side effect) or compute a value but not both.
- JavaScript is lenient with the number of arguments passed to a function.
- Default parameters can be set with the `=` operator in function definitions.

## Naming Functions
- Use clear, action-based names like `createUser` or `sendUserData`.
- Avoid generic names and be consistent with naming conventions.
- Follow JavaScript convention: camelCase function names like `sayHello`.

## Indentation
- Properly indent function code for readability.
- The convention is to use 2 spaces for indentation.

## Best Practices
- Aim for precise verb/action-based names.
- Use camelCasing for function names.
- Ensure proper indentation.
- Single-task focus: compute a value or perform a side effect, not both.
