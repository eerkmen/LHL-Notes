# Scope in JavaScript

## Understanding Scope
- Scope determines the accessibility of variables in JavaScript.
- Global scope: Variables are accessible everywhere.
- Local scope: Variables are confined to the function they are defined in.

## Global vs Local Scopes
- Global variables can be accessed in any part of the code.
- Local variables can only be accessed within their functions.

## Scoping and Variable Overwrites
- Local variables with the same name as global variables will take precedence in their scope.

## Best Practices
- Functions should ideally not read from outer scope variables.
- Data needed by functions should be passed as parameters/arguments.

## Rule 5 for Defining Functions
- Avoid accessing global scope; pass data as parameters.

## The Five Rules Recap
1. Precise verb/action-based function names.
2. Use camelCase for function names.
3. Properly indent function code.
4. Functions should focus on a single task.
5. Pass necessary data as parameters/arguments.

## Conclusion
- Differentiating between local and global scope is crucial.
- Following scope best practices enhances code readability and maintainability.
