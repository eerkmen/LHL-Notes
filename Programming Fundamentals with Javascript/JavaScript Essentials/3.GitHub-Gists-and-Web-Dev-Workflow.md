# GitHub Gists and Forking for Web Development Projects

## Understanding GitHub Gists

Gists are a feature offered by GitHub allowing users to share small snippets of code. They're simpler than full repositories and are ideal for code that doesn't require the complexity of a full GitHub repo. Gists can be public or secret, with the former being searchable and the latter only accessible via a direct URL.

## Differences Between Gists and Repositories

- Gists are assigned a unique identifier rather than a user-defined name.
- They do not support direct contributions from multiple users. Forking is required before cloning.
- There are two types of gists: public and secret.

## Forking and Cloning Gists

Forking is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's repository or gist. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original. 

### Steps for Forking a Gist:

1. Browse and click the Fork button on the gist page.
2. Copy the SSH URL of the gist.
3. Clone the gist using the copied URL into your working directory.

When cloning, you can specify a directory name to avoid the default unique identifier name that GitHub assigns to your gist.

## Using Gists for Assignments

The guide outlines using gists for code-sharing and how to fork and clone them for assignments. It's a convenient way to begin working on coding challenges, like the "What should I do for lunch?" JavaScript problem.

## Problem Solving with JavaScript

The chunk includes a challenge that involves creating a JavaScript program using variables, types, operators, and conditionals to decide what to do for lunch based on hunger and available time.

### Steps for the Challenge:

1. Fork and clone the necessary gist.
2. Execute `node lunch.js` to run the code.
3. Write conditional statements inside the `whatToDoForLunch` function to solve the problem.
4. Refactor the code to improve its quality.

## Version Control with Git

After implementing the solution, the document guides through committing and pushing changes to the gist repository.
