   ```

4. Create a README file:
   ```sh
   touch README.md
   ```

5. Add README to the repository:
   ```sh
   git add README.md
   ```

6. Commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit with blank README"
   ```

### Pushing to GitHub

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub named `lighthouse-web-notes`.
2. Link the local repository with the remote one:

   git remote add origin <URL>
   ```
3. Push the changes to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```
