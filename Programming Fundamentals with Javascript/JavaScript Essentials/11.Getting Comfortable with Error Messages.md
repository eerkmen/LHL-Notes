# Getting Comfortable with Error Messages

Understanding and resolving error messages is an essential skill in coding. Here's a breakdown of common errors and tips on debugging them.

## Common Errors in JavaScript

### Syntax Errors
- Occur when the code's syntax is incorrect.
- Error messages point to the file and line number to check.

### Stack Traces
- Provide the state of the program when an error occurred.
- Helps identify the source of the error, even in nested files.

### Reference Errors
- Triggered when referring to a variable that is not defined.
- Often caused by typos or incorrect variable names.

### Type Errors
- Arise when an operation is performed on an incompatible data type.
- For example, calling a method that doesn't exist on a data type.

## Debugging Tips

- Read error messages closely to pinpoint the exact issue.
- Inspect the indicated line for typos or logical errors.
- Use online resources like MDN for function references.
- Discuss with peers or mentors for additional insights.

## The Pattern for Fixing Errors

1. **Read the Error**: Start with the file and line number.
2. **Understand the Error**: Analyze the type and description.
3. **Inspect the Code**: Look at the indicated line and surrounding code.
4. **Research**: Use the internet or documentation if needed.
5. **Fix & Test**: Correct the mistake and run the code again.
6. **Iterate**: If the error persists, repeat the process.

As you gain experience, you'll improve in recognizing and fixing errors more swiftly.
