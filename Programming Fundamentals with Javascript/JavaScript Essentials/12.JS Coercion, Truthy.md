# JavaScript: Type Coercion, Truthy and Falsy Values, and Comparison Operators

## Type Coercion
Type coercion in JavaScript can lead to unexpected results when using the `==` operator, as it converts the values to the same type before comparing them. This is different from the `===` operator, which compares both value and type, thus being more predictable and safer to use in most cases【38†source】.

For example:
```javascript
23 === "23" // false, different types
23 == "23"  // true, type coercion occurs
```
## Not Equal Operators
- **Not Strictly Equal (!==)**: Checks if values are not equal or not the same type without coercion.
- **Not Equal (!=)**: Forces type coercion before checking if values are not equal.

## Truthy and Falsy Values
JavaScript has concepts of truthy and falsy values. A truthy value is anything that translates to true in a Boolean context, whereas a falsy value translates to false. JavaScript defines the following values as inherently falsy【98†source】:

- `false`
- `0`, `-0`, `0n`
- `""` (empty string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

Examples of truthy values include【98†source】:
- `true`
- `{}` (empty object)
- `[]` (empty array)
- Any non-zero number or string
- `new Date()`
- `Infinity`, `-Infinity`

## Comparing Values
When comparing values, it is generally advised to use `===` and `!==` operators to prevent unexpected type coercion. The `==` and `!=` operators can lead to confusion and bugs by converting values to the same type before comparison.

## Double Equals, Triple Equals, and Not Equal
The `==` operator performs type coercion, which can be counterintuitive. The `===` operator does not coerce types and is thus preferable for ensuring the values being compared are of the same type【38†source】.

## Rule of Thumb
Avoid using `==` and `!=` unless you specifically need type coercion. Prefer using `===` and `!==` for clarity and to avoid unintentional type conversions.

## Practical Usage
- **Falsy values** can be used to check conditions succinctly.
  - Example: 
    ```javascript
    if (!username) {
      username = 'Siobhan';
    }
    ```
  - Checks if `username` is empty (falsey) before assigning a new value.

- **Array.length** returns `0` for an empty array, which is a falsey value.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    if (!shoppingList.length) {
      shoppingList.push('coconut milk');
    }
    ```
  - Adds 'coconut milk' to the `shoppingList` if it's empty.

Remember to always test your assumptions when working with type coercion and to use the strict comparison operators (`===` and `!==`) unless there is a specific reason not to.
