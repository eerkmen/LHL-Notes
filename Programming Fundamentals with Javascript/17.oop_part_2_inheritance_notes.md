# OOP Part 2: Inheritance



## Reading Duration

45 - 60 minutes



## Overview

This reading introduces the concept of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as a means to organize and reduce code duplication across multiple classes in JavaScript.



## Key Concepts



### The Problem of Duplication

- Duplication in classes like `Student` and `Mentor` that share identical constructors and methods.



### Inheritance as a Solution

- Inheritance allows for a base class (e.g., `Person`) to encapsulate shared code.

- Subclasses (`Student`, `Mentor`) extend the base class to inherit shared behavior and state, while also maintaining their unique attributes.



### Implementing Inheritance

- Use the `extends` keyword in JavaScript for subclasses to inherit from a superclass.

- Example implementation:

  ```javascript

  class Person {

    constructor(name, quirkyFact) {

      this.name = name;

      this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;

    }

    bio() {

      return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;

    }

  }



  class Student extends Person {

    enroll(cohort) {

      this.cohort = cohort;

    }

  }



  class Mentor extends Person {

    goOnShift() {

      this.onShift = true;

    }

    goOffShift() {

      this.onShift = false;

    }

  }```
  
### Exploring Inheritance

  - Experiment with modifying the superclass and observe how it impacts the subclasses.
  - Add methods and properties to the superclass and use them in subclass instances.

## Conclusion

  - Inheritance in OOP is a powerful tool for organizing code and reducing duplication.
  - Understanding how to create subclasses in JavaScript enhances the ability to write modular and maintainable code.
