# Simple OOP in JavaScript (Review)

## Overview
This reading revisits the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, focusing on how objects can be used to organize code and encapsulate related properties and methods.

## Key Concepts

### Basic Structure in JavaScript
- **Variables**: Represent state or data.
- **Functions**: Define behavior or actions.
- **Objects**: Group related variables and functions.

### Terminology in OOP
- **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods).
- **Property**: A key-value pair inside an object, representing the object's state.
- **Method**: A function within an object, representing the object's behavior.

### Understanding `this` in JavaScript
- The keyword `this` refers to the object that a method is called on.
- It provides context within methods, linking to the object's properties and other methods.

### Example of OOP in JavaScript
```javascript
const dog = {
  sound: "woof",
  breed: "shih tzu",
  speak: function() {
    console.log(`${this.breed} says ${this.sound}`);
  }
};
```

- In the example, `dog` is an object with properties (`sound`, `breed`) and a method (`speak`).

## Conclusion
- Objects in JavaScript encapsulate state and behavior, promoting modularity and code organization.
- Understanding and utilizing OOP principles in JavaScript leads to more manageable and coherent code structures.
