# GitHub Gists and Workflow Guide

## What's a Gist?

- **Gists** are a convenient way to share small "snippets" of code.
- They are simplified git repositories, ideal for small, single-file projects or notes.
- Gists come in two types: **public** (searchable and discoverable) and **secret** (accessible only via URL).

## Gists vs. Full Repositories

- Gists can't be named; they get a unique hash as their identifier.
- Direct collaboration on a single gist isn't possible, unlike repos.
- You need to fork gists to contribute or make changes.

## Forking and Cloning Gists

### Forking a Gist

1. Go to the gist you wish to clone.
2. Click the **Fork** button to create your personal copy.

### Cloning a Gist

1. Copy the SSH URL of your forked gist.
2. Open Terminal and navigate to your work directory.

   cd /path/to/your/directory

3. Clone the gist using the copied SSH URL:

   git clone git@gist.github.com:YOUR_FORKS_ID.git folder-name

   Replace `YOUR_FORKS_ID` with your actual fork's ID and `folder-name` with a name of your choice for the local directory.

### First Forked Gist

- It is recommended to name your cloned directory to avoid confusion with the default hash name.

### Confirming the Clone

- Verify the contents of the cloned gist by navigating into the directory and listing the files.

  cd /path/to/cloned/gist
  ls -lah
  pwd # Confirm directory

## Conclusion

- Gists are useful for handling small amounts of code and sharing them either publicly or privately.
- Forking is essential for making personal copies of gists to work on without affecting the original source.
- Ready to use this knowledge for coding challenges like "What should I do for Lunch?".
