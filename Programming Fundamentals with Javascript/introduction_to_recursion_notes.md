# Introduction to Recursion

Recursion is an essential concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's an alternative to traditional looping mechanisms such as for or while loops.

## Understanding Recursion

Recursion involves a function calling itself with a modified input until a base condition is met. Here's an example of counting even numbers from 0 to 12 using recursion:

```javascript
function countEvenToTwelve(number) {
  if (number <= 12) { // Recursive Case
    console.log(number);
    countEvenToTwelve(number + 2); // Recursive call
  }
  // Base case is implicit when number > 12
}
countEvenToTwelve(0); // Initial call to the function
```

## Key Points in Recursion

- **Recursive Case**: The condition under which the function continues to call itself.
- **Base Case**: The condition under which the function stops calling itself, preventing an infinite loop.

## Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful tool that can simplify complex iterative tasks. It requires at least one recursive case and one base case to function correctly. Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to the base case until it's simple enough to solve directly.
