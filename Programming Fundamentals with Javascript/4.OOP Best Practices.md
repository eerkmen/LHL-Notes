# OOP Best Practices - Study Notes

## Overview

This reading covers the primary goals and best practices in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), aiming to produce more correct and idiomatic OO code.

## OOP Goals
1. **Reduce duplicated code** (Reusability)
2. **Breaking code into sensibly-divided units** (Modularity)
3. **Simplifying complex systems** for easier reading, writing, and maintenance

## Best Practices in OOP

### Abstraction
- **Concept**: Hiding complex details, providing a simple interface.
- **Example**: Driving different types of cars without knowing the intricate details of each car's mechanics.
- **Application in OOP**: Changing internal workings without affecting how others interact with the object.
- **Abstracting Pizza Example**:
  - **Initial Design**: `Pizza` class using a string to store toppings.
  - **Refined Design**: Using an array and exposing an `addTopping` method for better abstraction.

### Private vs Public
- **Public Interface**: Methods like `addTopping` should be the primary way of interacting with an object.
- **Private Properties**: In JavaScript, properties can be pseudo-private using an underscore prefix (e.g., `_toppings`), indicating they should not be accessed directly.

### Single Responsibility Principle
- **Principle**: A class should only have one job or reason to change.
- **Violations**: A class managing state, sending notifications, and handling database interactions.
- **Solution**: Breaking the class into multiple classes, each handling a specific responsibility.

### Inheritance
- **Purpose**: To reduce duplicate code and share behavior between classes.
- **Example**: `Flower`, `Tree`, and `Bush` classes all inheriting from a `Plant` class.

## Why Use OOP?
- **Modularization Strategy**: Provides an alternative strategy for breaking down complex problems.
- **Language Dependence**: While optional in languages like JavaScript, it's a necessity in OO languages like Ruby, C++, or Swift.
- **Decision Making**: The choice to use OOP depends on personal comfort, project needs, and team decisions.

## Conclusion
- **Effective OOP**: Involves balancing abstraction, proper use of public and private interfaces, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, and utilizing inheritance appropriately.
- **Flexibility**: OOP provides a powerful toolset for modularizing code, but its use depends on the context and requirements of the project.
